Java Bank Card Management GUI
A complete Java Swing-based graphical application for managing Bank Card Information, designed to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming, GUI development, and exception handling in real-world applications. This project is ideal for Java learners or those building banking or fintech simulation tools for academic or training purposes.



Overview
This project offers a feature-rich Bank Card Management System that allows users to manage both Debit and Credit Cards through a user-friendly interface. The application is developed using Java Swing and AWT libraries and is structured to apply core OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
The system is built to store card data using Java's ArrayList, offering a flexible way to dynamically manage objects. The project also emphasizes event-driven programming by integrating Javaâ€™s ActionListener to manage GUI events.



Key Features
Dual Card Support: Manage both Debit and Credit Cards with dedicated input forms.
Data Storage: Card details are stored in a dynamically growing ArrayList.
Input Validation: Checks for empty fields, duplicate IDs, incorrect PINs, and invalid data entries.
Exception Handling: Gracefully handles runtime issues such as input mismatches or logic violations.
Functional Operations:Add new debit or credit card, Withdraw amount from debit card, Set a credit limit for credit card, Cancel a credit card, Display card details in an organized format, Clear form entries
Clean GUI Design: Uses JFrame, JPanel, JTextField, JLabel, JComboBox, and JButton.
Modular Codebase: Well-structured classes for extensibility and readability.
Tested and Documented: Includes extensive testing of all functionalities and screenshots of successful transactions and validation.
